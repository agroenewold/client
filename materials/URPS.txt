Our KIM App should be available and accessible to anyone who has an Android device with the app
downloaded on it, has an internet connection, and knows a username and password for the app.
Information about specific stocks will be updated automatically through the internet so that
information should be quite accurate and up-to-date. The specific stocks shown and the weekly
stock pitch will be updated by KIM leadership/sector heads via administrator accounts, so that
information will be as accurate and up-to-date as the leadership makes it (ideally they will
update it weekly). It should work well when all 50 members of KIM are using it simultaneously
and it should work on a variety of screen sizes and devices. It should look nice and be intuitive
to use. Users should be able to easily find and sort information about KIM stocks and should be
able to find and read training materials and that week’s stock pitch. It should crash as little
as possible and run as quickly as possible without using an extensive amount of resources.
