# Project Vision
  Our application is designed to improve the efficiency of the core operations of Calvin's Knight Investment Management student club. It will monitor the stocks in which the club has invested by providing a list of these stocks that will display their current value and any other information deemed relevant. Due to confidentiality rules, this part of the app will be password protected. Second, our app will provide a convenient way to display the club's weekly stock pitches. The subgroup making the pitch will upload the pitch and then members of the club will be able to open the app to see the details of the pitch. Third, the app will contain the training guide given to every new member.
  Calvin's Knight Investment Management student club currently does paper presentations for its stock pitches, and uses paper training guides for its new members. Our application will allow the club to save paper and will also provide easier access to the training guides. It will make it easier for the club members to locate previous stock pitches because these pitches will be accessible from their mobile phones. Compared to other stock monitor apps, our app is tailored specifically to the Knight Investment Management student club, so it can include both the stock pitches and the training materials in addition to the club's stock information.
